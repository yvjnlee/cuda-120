#### day 1 notes

Date: 2025-09-27

ok this is technically written at 1 am the next day but holy shit it works.

i installed like 3 versions of gcc and 2 versions of cuda to get this shit to work on bare metal.

didnt work.

in fact it took me like 4 days of straight waiting for the installs from the AUR to realize this approach wont work.

however just used a docker contianer with ubuntu instead and thank god this shit works.

im the goat.

well thats hello world out the way, on to whatever shit is next.

if im struggling with hello world, i cant wait to see how much more suffering awaits.

i cant wait.

### a) **Core Components**
- **Cores**: Modern CPUs range from 2 to 64 cores, optimized for high single-threaded performance.
- **Cache Hierarchy**:
  - **L1 Cache**: Fastest and smallest (16-64 KB per core), directly connected to each core.
  - **L2 Cache**: Larger and slightly slower (256-512 KB per core), serving as a bridge between L1 and L3.
  - **L3 Cache**: Shared among all cores (several MB), providing a larger pool of cached data.
- **Branch Prediction & Out-of-Order Execution**: Enhances performance by predicting future instructions and executing instructions out of order to optimize pipeline usage.
- **Instruction Pipelines**: CPUs execute instructions through highly optimized pipelines, allowing for complex instruction sets and rapid context switching.

### b) **Strengths**
- **Low Latency**: Optimized for tasks requiring quick response times.
- **Complex Control Flow**: Handles branching and diverse instruction sets efficiently.
- **Single-Threaded Performance**: Excels at tasks that cannot be easily parallelized.

## 5. Execution Models: SIMD vs. SIMT

### a) **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)**
- **Used By**: CPUs with vector instructions (e.g., SSE, AVX).
- **Concept**: Executes the same instruction on multiple data points simultaneously.
- **Limitations**: Limited parallelism; often requires data to be contiguous and operations to be uniform.

### b) **SIMT (Single Instruction, Multiple Threads)**
- **Used By**: GPUs (CUDA model).
- **Concept**: Executes the same instruction across multiple threads, each operating on its own data.
- **Advantages**:
  - **Flexibility**: Threads can have their own control flow, allowing for more complex parallelism.
  - **Scalability**: Efficiently manages thousands of threads with minimal overhead.

### **Diagram: SIMD vs. SIMT**

    end
```

|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Granularity** | Operates on vectors of data simultaneously     | Operates on individual threads executing in parallel |
| **Flexibility** | Limited to operations on homogeneous data      | Supports divergent control flow within warps       |
| **Scalability** | Limited by vector length (e.g., 8, 16 elements) | Scales to thousands of threads with minimal overhead |

## 6. Memory Hierarchy Comparison

### a) **CPU Memory Hierarchy**
- **Registers**: Fastest, per-core storage for immediate data.
- **L1 Cache**: Very fast, per-core cache for frequently accessed data.
- **L2 Cache**: Slightly slower, larger cache shared between a few cores.
- **L3 Cache**: Slower, shared across all cores, serving as a last-level cache before main memory.
- **Main Memory (RAM)**: Large, high-latency memory for general-purpose data storage.
- **Storage (SSD/HDD)**: Very large, highest latency storage for persistent data.

### b) **GPU Memory Hierarchy**
- **Registers**: Fastest, per-thread storage for immediate data.
- **Shared Memory**: Fast, on-chip memory shared among threads within a block, used for cooperative data sharing.
- **L1 Cache**: Combined with shared memory; configurable to allocate more to shared or cache memory.
- **Global Memory**: Large, high-latency memory accessible by all threads, similar to main memory in CPUs.
- **Constant & Texture Memory**: Read-only memory optimized for specific access patterns, benefiting from caching mechanisms.

    end
```

*Figure 5: Memory hierarchy comparison between CPU and GPU.*

### c) **Performance Implications**
- **Latency**:
  - **CPU**: Lower latency caches (L1, L2) enhance single-threaded performance.
  - **GPU**: Higher latency global memory necessitates efficient use of shared memory and coalesced accesses.
- **Bandwidth**:
  - **CPU**: High bandwidth between caches and main memory, but limited by fewer cores.
  - **GPU**: Extremely high memory bandwidth supports massive parallel data processing.

---

## 7. Implications for CUDA Programming

### a) **Optimizing Memory Access**
- **Coalesced Access**: Ensure threads within a warp access contiguous memory locations to maximize memory bandwidth.
  - **Example**:
    ```cpp
    __global__ void coalescedAccess(float *A, float *B, float *C, int N) {
        int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
        if(idx < N) {
            C[idx] = A[idx] + B[idx];
        }
    }
    ```
- **Shared Memory Utilization**: Use shared memory to cache frequently accessed data and reduce global memory accesses.
  - **Example**:
    ```cpp
    __global__ void sharedMemoryExample(float *A, float *B, float *C, int N) {
        extern __shared__ float sharedData[];
        int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
        
        if(idx < N) {
            sharedData[threadIdx.x] = A[idx];
            __syncthreads();
            C[idx] = sharedData[threadIdx.x] + B[idx];
        }
    }
    ```
- **Minimize Memory Latency**: Organize data to fit into caches and shared memory to reduce access times.

### b) **Maximizing Parallelism**
- **Occupancy**: Strive for high occupancy (number of active warps per SM) to hide memory latency and maximize resource utilization.
  - **Example**: Adjust block size to ensure enough warps are active.
- **Thread Divergence**: Minimize divergence within warps to ensure all threads execute the same instruction simultaneously.
  - **Example**: Avoid excessive branching inside kernels.

### c) **Choosing the Right Execution Model**
- **SIMT Benefits**: Leverage SIMT by designing kernels that execute uniform operations across large datasets.
- **Control Flow Management**: Be cautious with conditional statements that can cause divergence, impacting performance.
  - **Example**:
    ```cpp
    __global__ void simtExample(float *A, float *B, float *C, int N) {
        int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
        if(idx < N) {
            if(A[idx] > 0) {
                C[idx] = A[idx] + B[idx];
            } else {
                C[idx] = A[idx] - B[idx];
            }
        }
    }
    ```

### d) **Balancing Workload**
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute work evenly across threads and blocks to prevent idle cores.
- **Granularity**: Choose the right level of parallelism—too fine can lead to overhead, too coarse can underutilize resources.

        cudaMemcpy(h_C, d_C, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);
    
        printf("GPU Vector Add Time: %lf seconds\n", ((double)(end - start))/CLOCKS_PER_SEC);
    
        cudaFree(d_A);
        cudaFree(d_B);
        cudaFree(d_C);
        free(h_A);
        free(h_B);
        free(h_C);
        return 0;
    }
    ```

### **Analysis**
- **CPU**: Executes the loop sequentially, limited by single-thread performance and cache hierarchy.
- **GPU**: Distributes the workload across thousands of threads, leveraging parallelism and high memory bandwidth to achieve significant speedup.

### **Discussion Points**
- **Speedup Factor**: Calculate the ratio of CPU time to GPU time to quantify performance gains.
- **Memory Transfer Overhead**: Consider the time taken to transfer data between host and device, which can impact overall performance.
- **Scalability**: Observe how performance scales with different data sizes and GPU architectures.

## 9. Common Pitfalls

1. **Ignoring Memory Coalescing**
   - **Issue**: Non-coalesced memory accesses can drastically reduce memory throughput on GPUs.
   - **Solution**: Ensure threads within a warp access contiguous memory addresses.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     __global__ void coalescedAccess(float *A, float *B, float *C, int N) {
         int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
         if(idx < N) {
             C[idx] = A[idx] + B[idx];
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Excessive Global Memory Access**
   - **Issue**: Frequent reads/writes to global memory introduce latency.
   - **Solution**: Utilize shared memory to cache frequently accessed data.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     __global__ void sharedMemoryExample(float *A, float *B, float *C, int N) {
         extern __shared__ float sharedData[];
         int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
         
         if(idx < N) {
             sharedData[threadIdx.x] = A[idx];
             __syncthreads();
             C[idx] = sharedData[threadIdx.x] + B[idx];
         }
     }
     ```

3. **Thread Divergence**
   - **Issue**: Branching within a warp causes threads to execute serially, negating parallelism benefits.
   - **Solution**: Design kernels to minimize conditional statements and ensure uniform execution paths.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     __global__ void simtExample(float *A, float *B, float *C, int N) {
         int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
         if(idx < N) {
             if(A[idx] > 0) {
                 C[idx] = A[idx] + B[idx];
             } else {
                 C[idx] = A[idx] - B[idx];
             }
         }
     }
     ```

4. **Over or Under-Provisioning Resources**
   - **Issue**:
     - **Over-Provisioning**: Assigning too many threads can lead to resource contention.
     - **Under-Provisioning**: Assigning too few threads fails to utilize the GPU fully.
   - **Solution**: Balance the number of threads and blocks based on the GPU’s architecture and the problem size.
   - **Tip**: Use CUDA occupancy calculators or profiling tools to find optimal configurations.

5. **Not Handling Errors**
   - **Issue**: CUDA functions can fail silently if errors aren't checked.
   - **Solution**: Always check the return status of CUDA API calls and kernel launches.
   - **Example**:
     ```cpp
     cudaError_t err = cudaMalloc(&d_A, size);
     if (err != cudaSuccess) {
         fprintf(stderr, "Failed to allocate device memory: %s\n", cudaGetErrorString(err));
         exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
     }
     ```

6. **Ignoring Occupancy**
   - **Issue**: Low occupancy means not all GPU cores are utilized, leading to suboptimal performance.
   - **Solution**: Use profiling tools to monitor occupancy and adjust kernel configurations accordingly.
   - **Tip**: Aim for high occupancy (e.g., 75-100%) but prioritize performance optimizations over mere occupancy.

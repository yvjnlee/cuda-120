# Day 25: Double Buffering Technique
In this lesson, we explore the **double buffering technique** in CUDA to overlap data transfers (communication) with computation. Double buffering is a common technique in high-performance computing to hide the latency of data transfers by using two sets of buffers: while one buffer is used for computation, the other is used for data transfer. This creates a pipeline where compute and copy operations run concurrently, thereby increasing throughput.

## 1. Overview

In many CUDA applications, the performance bottleneck is often not the computation itself, but rather the **data transfer** between host and device. Double buffering addresses this problem by using two sets of buffers to overlap computation with data transfers. This technique ensures that while the GPU is processing data from one buffer, the next chunk of data is transferred into the alternate buffer.

---

## 2. What is Double Buffering?

**Double Buffering** is a technique where two buffers are used to alternate between transferring data and performing computations. The basic idea is:
- **Buffer 0** is used for computation while **Buffer 1** is being loaded with new data.
- Once the computation on Buffer 0 is finished, the roles are swapped.
- This overlap helps hide the latency of data transfers, leading to improved throughput.

---

## 3. How Double Buffering Works in CUDA

In CUDA, double buffering is typically implemented using:
- **Pinned (page-locked) host memory** for fast asynchronous transfers.
- **Two device buffers** that are used alternately.
- **CUDA Streams** to schedule asynchronous memory copies (`cudaMemcpyAsync()`) and kernel launches concurrently.
- **Synchronization** to ensure that the computation and memory transfers do not overlap incorrectly, which could result in reading incomplete data.

## 4. Practical Exercise: Implementing a Two-Buffer Pipeline

We will implement a simple vector addition using a double-buffering technique. The process involves:
1. Splitting the data into chunks.
2. Using two device buffers (Buffer 0 and Buffer 1) to overlap data transfers with computation.
3. Using CUDA streams and events for asynchronous operations and proper synchronization.

### 4.1. Sample Kernel Code

```cpp
// vectorAddKernel.cu
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// Simple vector addition kernel that processes one data chunk.
// Each thread computes one element of the output vector.
__global__ void vectorAddKernel(const float *A, const float *B, float *C, int chunkSize) {
    int idx = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    if (idx < chunkSize) {
        C[idx] = A[idx] + B[idx];
    }
}
```

Comments:  
This kernel is identical to a basic vector addition kernel.  
It processes a "chunk" of data, where the size of the chunk is passed as a parameter.

### 4.2. Host Code with Detailed Error Checking and Double Buffering
Below is the host code that implements double buffering. It uses pinned memory for fast transfers and two device buffers to overlap memory transfers with kernel computation.

```cpp
// doubleBufferingPipeline.cu
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

// Declaration of the vector addition kernel.
__global__ void vectorAddKernel(const float *A, const float *B, float *C, int chunkSize);

// Macro for error checking.
#define CUDA_CHECK(call) {                                    \
    cudaError_t err = call;                                   \
    if(err != cudaSuccess) {                                 \
        printf("CUDA Error at %s:%d - %s\n", __FILE__, __LINE__, cudaGetErrorString(err)); \
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);                                   \
    }                                                         \
}

int main() {
    // Total vector size and chunk size.
    int totalElements = 1 << 22;  // e.g., 4M elements
    int chunkSize = 1 << 20;      // Process in chunks of 1M elements
    size_t chunkBytes = chunkSize * sizeof(float);
    size_t totalBytes = totalElements * sizeof(float);

    for (int i = 0; i < totalElements; i++) {
        h_A[i] = (float)(rand() % 100) / 10.0f;

        int currentChunkSize = ((offset + chunkSize) <= totalElements) ? chunkSize : (totalElements - offset);
        size_t currentChunkBytes = currentChunkSize * sizeof(float);

        // If chunk is even, use buffers 0; if odd, use buffers 1.
        float *d_A = (chunk % 2 == 0) ? d_A0 : d_A1;

Detailed Comments Explanation:  

a. Memory Allocation:  
- Pinned Memory Allocation:  
cudaMallocHost() is used to allocate host memory for arrays h_A, h_B, and h_C to enable high-throughput asynchronous transfers.  

- Device Memory Allocation:  
Two sets of device buffers (d_A0/d_B0/d_C0 and d_A1/d_B1/d_C1) are allocated, one for each of the two buffers used in double buffering.  

b. Stream Creation:  
Two CUDA streams (stream0 and stream1) are created to perform asynchronous transfers and kernel launches concurrently.  

- Event Creation and Timing:  
CUDA events (start and stop) are created to measure the total execution time of the entire pipeline.  

c. The start event is recorded before beginning the loop, and the stop event is recorded after all processing is complete.  
- Processing Loop (Double Buffering Pipeline):  The data is divided into chunks; each chunk is processed separately.  

- A ping-pong mechanism is used to alternate between two sets of device buffers, allowing one buffer to be used for computation while the other is being loaded/unloaded.  

- For each chunk:  
a. Asynchronous Memory Transfer:  
The current chunk of data is copied asynchronously from the pinned host memory to the appropriate device buffer using cudaMemcpyAsync().
 
d. Kernel Launch:  
The vectorAddKernel is launched in the corresponding stream, processing the current chunk.  

e. Result Copy:  
The result is copied back asynchronously to the host. The host then synchronizes with cudaDeviceSynchronize() to ensure all streams have finished.  

f. Cleanup:  
All device memory, streams, events, and pinned host memory are freed or destroyed properly.  

g. Performance Measurement:  
The elapsed time is computed using cudaEventElapsedTime() and printed.

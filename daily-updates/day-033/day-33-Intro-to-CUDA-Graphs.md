# Day 33: Intro to CUDA Graphs

CUDA Graphs provide a way to capture and reuse a sequence of CUDA operations (kernels, memory copies, etc.) as a single executable graph. By converting a sequence of operations into a graph, you can reduce launch overhead and potentially improve performance, especially for workloads with fixed execution patterns. However, mistakes during graph capture (such as failing to capture all necessary operations or capturing operations in an unintended order) can lead to unexpected results.

In this lesson, we will:
- Introduce CUDA Graphs and explain their benefits.
- Convert a simple kernel sequence into a CUDA Graph.
- Measure performance differences between traditional kernel launches and graph launches.
- Discuss common pitfalls and best practices for graph capture.

## 1. Overview

Traditionally, each kernel launch and memory copy in CUDA incurs overhead. CUDA Graphs allow you to capture a sequence of operations into a single executable unit, reducing the launch overhead and improving performance when the sequence is repeated multiple times. This is especially beneficial for workloads with a fixed control flow.

---

## 2. Introduction to CUDA Graphs

- **What Are CUDA Graphs?**  
  CUDA Graphs allow you to capture and then instantiate a graph that represents a sequence of CUDA operations. Once instantiated, the graph can be launched with very low overhead compared to individual kernel launches.

- **Benefits:**  
  - Reduced launch overhead.
  - Better performance for repeated executions of fixed operation sequences.
  - Simplified management of complex dependencies among kernels and memory operations.

- **Workflow Overview:**  
  1. **Begin Capture:** Start capturing CUDA operations into a stream.
  2. **Launch Operations:** Perform your normal CUDA operations (kernel launches, memory copies, etc.).
  3. **End Capture:** End the capture to produce a `cudaGraph_t`.
  4. **Instantiate Graph:** Convert the graph to an executable form (`cudaGraphExec_t`).
  5. **Launch Graph:** Run the graph multiple times with minimal overhead.

---

## 3. Practical Exercise: Converting a Kernel Sequence into a CUDA Graph

We will create a simple pipeline that performs two operations:
- **Kernel A:** Vector addition.
- **Kernel B:** Scaling of the resulting vector.

We will first implement the standard kernel launch sequence, then capture this sequence into a CUDA graph, and finally compare the performance.

### a) Standard Kernel Launch Sequence

```cpp
// standardKernelSequence.cu
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

// Kernel A: Vector Addition.
__global__ void vectorAddKernel(const float *A, const float *B, float *C, int N) {
    int idx = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    if (idx < N) {
        C[idx] = A[idx] + B[idx];
    }
}

// Kernel B: Vector Scaling.
__global__ void vectorScaleKernel(float *C, float scale, int N) {
    int idx = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    if (idx < N) {
        C[idx] *= scale;
    }
}

#define CUDA_CHECK(call) { \
    cudaError_t err = call; \
    if(err != cudaSuccess) { \
        printf("CUDA Error at %s:%d - %s\n", __FILE__, __LINE__, cudaGetErrorString(err)); \
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE); \
    } \
}

int main() {
    int N = 1 << 20;  // 1M elements.
    size_t size = N * sizeof(float);

    // Allocate host memory.
    float *h_A = (float*)malloc(size);
    float *h_B = (float*)malloc(size);
    float *h_C = (float*)malloc(size);

    // Initialize input vectors.
    srand(time(NULL));
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        h_A[i] = (float)(rand() % 100) / 10.0f;
        h_B[i] = (float)(rand() % 100) / 10.0f;
    }

    // Allocate device memory.
    float *d_A, *d_B, *d_C;
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaMalloc(&d_A, size));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaMalloc(&d_B, size));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaMalloc(&d_C, size));

    // Copy data from host to device.
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaMemcpy(d_A, h_A, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaMemcpy(d_B, h_B, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice));

    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

    // Launch Kernel A (Vector Addition).
    vectorAddKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_A, d_B, d_C, N);
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaDeviceSynchronize());

    // Launch Kernel B (Vector Scaling with a scale factor of 2.0).
    vectorScaleKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_C, 2.0f, N);
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaDeviceSynchronize());

    // Copy result back to host.
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaMemcpy(h_C, d_C, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost));

    // (Optional) Print first 10 elements.
    printf("Standard Kernel Sequence Results (first 10 elements):\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        printf("%f ", h_C[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    // Cleanup.
    free(h_A);
    free(h_B);
    free(h_C);
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaFree(d_A));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaFree(d_B));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaFree(d_C));

    return 0;
}
```

*Comments:*
- This code demonstrates the traditional sequential launch of two kernels.
- Kernel A performs vector addition, and Kernel B scales the result.
- Host memory is allocated and initialized, data is copied to the device, kernels are launched sequentially, and the result is copied back.

---

### b) Capturing the Kernel Sequence as a CUDA Graph

We now convert the above kernel sequence into a CUDA graph to reduce launch overhead.

```cpp
// cudaGraphVectorPipeline.cu
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

// Kernel A: Vector Addition.
__global__ void vectorAddKernel(const float *A, const float *B, float *C, int N) {
    int idx = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    if (idx < N) {
        C[idx] = A[idx] + B[idx];
    }
}

// Kernel B: Vector Scaling.
__global__ void vectorScaleKernel(float *C, float scale, int N) {
    int idx = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    if (idx < N) {
        C[idx] *= scale;
    }
}

#define CUDA_CHECK(call) { \
    cudaError_t err = call; \
    if(err != cudaSuccess) { \
        printf("CUDA Error at %s:%d - %s\n", __FILE__, __LINE__, cudaGetErrorString(err)); \
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE); \
    } \
}

int main() {
    int N = 1 << 20;  // 1M elements.
    size_t size = N * sizeof(float);

    // Allocate host memory.
    float *h_A = (float*)malloc(size);
    float *h_B = (float*)malloc(size);
    float *h_C = (float*)malloc(size);

    // Initialize input vectors.
    srand(time(NULL));
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        h_A[i] = (float)(rand() % 100) / 10.0f;
        h_B[i] = (float)(rand() % 100) / 10.0f;
    }

    // Allocate device memory.
    float *d_A, *d_B, *d_C;
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaMalloc(&d_A, size));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaMalloc(&d_B, size));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaMalloc(&d_C, size));

    // Copy data from host to device.
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaMemcpy(d_A, h_A, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaMemcpy(d_B, h_B, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice));

    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

    // Create a stream for graph capture.
    cudaStream_t captureStream;
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaStreamCreate(&captureStream));

    // Begin graph capture.
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaStreamBeginCapture(captureStream, cudaStreamCaptureModeGlobal));

    // Launch Kernel A (Vector Addition) in the capture stream.
    vectorAddKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock, 0, captureStream>>>(d_A, d_B, d_C, N);

    // Launch Kernel B (Vector Scaling) in the capture stream.
    vectorScaleKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock, 0, captureStream>>>(d_C, 2.0f, N);

    // End graph capture.
    cudaGraph_t graph;
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaStreamEndCapture(captureStream, &graph));

    // Instantiate the graph.
    cudaGraphExec_t graphExec;
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaGraphInstantiate(&graphExec, graph, NULL, NULL, 0));

    // Create CUDA events for timing.
    cudaEvent_t start, stop;
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaEventCreate(&start));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaEventCreate(&stop));

    CUDA_CHECK(cudaEventRecord(start, 0));
    // Launch the graph.
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaGraphLaunch(graphExec, 0));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaEventRecord(stop, 0));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaEventSynchronize(stop));

    float graphTime = 0;
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaEventElapsedTime(&graphTime, start, stop));
    printf("CUDA Graph Execution Time: %f ms\n", graphTime);

    // Copy the result back to host.
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaMemcpy(h_C, d_C, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost));

    // Print first 10 results for verification.
    printf("Results from CUDA Graph (first 10 elements):\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        printf("%f ", h_C[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    // Cleanup: Destroy graph, free device memory, free host memory, destroy stream and events.
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaGraphDestroy(graph));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaGraphExecDestroy(graphExec));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaFree(d_A));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaFree(d_B));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaFree(d_C));
    free(h_A);
    free(h_B);
    free(h_C);
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaStreamDestroy(captureStream));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaEventDestroy(start));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaEventDestroy(stop));

    return 0;
}
```

**Detailed Comments:**
- **Graph Capture:**  
  We create a stream (`captureStream`) and begin capturing operations using `cudaStreamBeginCapture()`.
- **Kernel Launches:**  
  Two kernels (vector addition and scaling) are launched in the capture stream.
- **Graph Instantiation:**  
  The captured operations are converted into a CUDA graph using `cudaStreamEndCapture()`, then instantiated with `cudaGraphInstantiate()`.
- **Graph Launch:**  
  The graph is launched using `cudaGraphLaunch()`, and CUDA events measure the execution time.
- **Verification:**  
  The result is copied back to host memory and printed for verification.
- **Cleanup:**  
  All resources (graph, device memory, stream, events) are destroyed and freed.

## 4. Common Debugging Pitfalls and Best Practices

| **Pitfall**                                       | **Solution**                                                  |
|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Not capturing all necessary operations           | Ensure that all dependent kernels and memory operations are launched within the capture stream. |
| Failing to end capture properly                    | Always call `cudaStreamEndCapture()` to obtain the graph; otherwise, the graph will be incomplete. |
| Not instantiating the graph correctly              | Use `cudaGraphInstantiate()` and check for errors.            |
| Inconsistent launch configurations between normal launches and graph capture | Maintain the same grid and block dimensions when capturing and launching the graph. |
| Forgetting to destroy the graph and free resources | Always clean up using `cudaGraphDestroy()` and `cudaGraphExecDestroy()`. |

# Day 33: Intro to CUDA Graphs â€“ Extended Explanation with Conceptual Diagrams

In **Day 33**, we introduced **CUDA Graphs**, a feature that allows you to capture and reuse a sequence of CUDA operations (kernels, memory copies, etc.) as a single executable unit. By capturing a workflow into a graph, we can reduce launch overhead and potentially improve performanceâ€”especially in repetitive scenarios. Below, we provide an extended explanation of the CUDA Graph workflow along with more detailed **conceptual diagrams**.

## 1. Overview

Traditionally, each CUDA operation (kernel launch, memory copy, etc.) is invoked individually, incurring some overhead per launch. **CUDA Graphs** allow you to capture a series of these operations into a single graph, which can then be **instantiated** and **launched** with significantly lower overheadâ€”particularly when the sequence of operations is repeated many times.

---

## 2. What Are CUDA Graphs?

### Core Ideas
1. **Capture Phase**: Operations within a stream (kernels, copies, etc.) are captured into a `cudaGraph_t`.
2. **Instantiation**: The captured graph is turned into an executable form `cudaGraphExec_t` via `cudaGraphInstantiate()`.
3. **Launch**: The executable graph is launched (with minimal overhead) via `cudaGraphLaunch()`.

### Use Cases
- **Repetitive Workloads**: Running the same sequence of kernels repeatedly.
- **Complex Pipelines**: Where multiple kernels, memory copies, and streams form a static dependency graph.
- **Performance Optimization**: Reducing per-launch overhead can yield significant speedups when launching many kernels.

---

## 3. Conceptual Diagrams

Below are two conceptual diagrams that illustrate how **CUDA Graphs** compare to the traditional sequential launch method, and a detailed breakdown of how a typical CUDA Graph workflow looks under the hood.

### a) Diagram: Traditional Sequential Launch vs. Graph Launch

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Traditional Sequential Launch
    A[Host: Kernel 1 Launch] --> B[Overhead]
    B --> C[Host: Kernel 2 Launch] --> D[Overhead]
    D --> E[Host: Kernel 3 Launch] --> F[Overhead]
    end

    subgraph CUDA Graph Launch
    G[Host: Create Graph & Capture Ops (Once)]
    G --> H[Graph Instantiation]
    H --> I[Single Graph Launch => All Kernels]
end
```

**Explanation:**
- **Traditional Sequential Launch**: Each kernel launch is issued by the host, incurring overhead multiple times.
- **CUDA Graph Launch**: All kernels and operations are captured once and then launched in a single graph invocation, reducing overhead significantly.

---

### b) Diagram: Detailed CUDA Graph Workflow

Below is a more **detailed** breakdown of how the CUDA Graph workflow is executed from an application perspective:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Host: Allocate Host & Device Memory]
    B[Host: Create or Reuse Stream (CaptureStream)]
    C[Begin Graph Capture: cudaStreamBeginCapture]
    D[Launch Ops in CaptureStream (Kernels, Mem Copies)]
    E[End Graph Capture: cudaStreamEndCapture => cudaGraph_t]
    F[Instantiate Graph: cudaGraphInstantiate => cudaGraphExec_t]
    G[Launch Graph: cudaGraphLaunch => Runs All Captured Ops]
    H[Host: Copy Results Back, Synchronize, Verify]
    I[Optionally Repeat Launch => Minimal Overhead]
    J[Cleanup: cudaGraphDestroy, Free Memory]

    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> E
    E --> F
    F --> G
    G --> H
    H --> I
    I --> J
```

**Explanation:**
1. **Capture**: The host issues operations in a specific stream while capture is enabled.
2. **Graph Creation**: Once capture ends, a `cudaGraph_t` object is produced.
3. **Instantiation**: The graph is turned into an executable graph (`cudaGraphExec_t`).
4. **Launch**: The host launches the graph, which executes the captured operations.
5. **Verification & Reuse**: Results are copied back to the host, and if needed, the graph can be launched multiple times with minimal overhead.
6. **Cleanup**: Resources are properly destroyed and freed.

---

## 4. Practical Example Recap

In the *practical example* from Day 33 (shown in the previous code snippets), we:

1. Created a **capture stream**.
2. Began capture using `cudaStreamBeginCapture()`.
3. Launched two kernels (vectorAddKernel and vectorScaleKernel) in the capture stream.
4. Ended capture to obtain a `cudaGraph_t`.
5. **Instantiated** the graph into a `cudaGraphExec_t`.
6. Measured **performance** by launching the graph and timing it with CUDA events.

By comparing the **traditional sequential** approach vs. **graph-based** approach, you can observe the differences in overhead and total runtime.

## 5. Common Debugging Pitfalls & Best Practices

| **Pitfall**                                                  | **Solution**                                                                                               |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Not capturing all required operations**                    | Ensure that every operation (kernel launch, memory copy) that should be part of the graph is launched in the capture stream. |
| **Forgetting to end capture**                                | Always call `cudaStreamEndCapture()` once your sequence of operations is complete.                         |
| **Incorrect graph instantiation**                            | Use `cudaGraphInstantiate()` and handle errors carefully.                                                 |
| **Not reusing the graph**                                    | The primary performance benefit comes from reusing the instantiated graph multiple times.                  |
| **Resource leaks**                                           | Destroy the graph (`cudaGraphDestroy()`) and the instantiated graph (`cudaGraphExecDestroy()`) once done.  |

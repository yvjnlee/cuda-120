# Day 23: Asynchronous Memory Copy

In this lesson, we explore **asynchronous memory copy** in CUDA. Asynchronous transfers allow data to be copied between host and device concurrently with kernel execution, thus overlapping communication and computation to improve overall performance. To achieve truly asynchronous transfers, using **pinned (page-locked) host memory** is essential.

## 1. Overview

CUDA operations such as kernel launches and memory transfers are by default **asynchronous**, meaning they return control to the CPU immediately. However, to truly achieve concurrency, especially when copying data between host and device, the host memory must be **pinned (page-locked)**. This lesson focuses on how to use **asynchronous memory copies** with pinned memory and CUDA streams to overlap data transfers with kernel execution for better performance.

---

## 2. Understanding Asynchronous Memory Copy

**Asynchronous Memory Copy** allows memory transfers (using `cudaMemcpyAsync()`) to run concurrently with kernel execution. Unlike the synchronous `cudaMemcpy()`, which blocks the host until the transfer is complete, `cudaMemcpyAsync()` initiates the transfer and returns control to the host immediately. This helps hide the latency of memory transfers if they are overlapped with computation.

**Key Points:**
- **Non-blocking:** The call returns immediately; the transfer happens concurrently.
- **Streams:** Transfers are associated with a CUDA stream; different streams can execute concurrently.
- **Overlap:** When combined with kernel execution, data transfers can occur in parallel, leading to improved performance.

---

## 3. Pinned (Page-Locked) Memory

For **asynchronous memory copy** to work effectively, the host memory used for transfers should be **pinned memory**. Pinned memory is allocated using `cudaMallocHost()` (or `cudaHostAlloc()`) and cannot be swapped out by the operating system. This results in:
- **Higher bandwidth:** Faster transfers between host and device.
- **True Asynchrony:** Enables concurrent execution of memory copies and kernels.

**Example Allocation:**
```cpp
float *h_data;
cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_data, size);  // Allocates pinned memory on the host.
```

## 4. Using `cudaMemcpyAsync()` and Streams

**`cudaMemcpyAsync()`** initiates an asynchronous transfer between host and device. It takes an additional parameter: the **CUDA stream** in which the operation is queued. Operations in different streams can overlap.

**Prototype:**
```cpp
cudaError_t cudaMemcpyAsync(void *dst, const void *src, size_t count, cudaMemcpyKind kind, cudaStream_t stream = 0);
```

**Key Steps:**
1. **Allocate Pinned Memory:** Use `cudaMallocHost()` for host memory.
2. **Create CUDA Streams:** Use `cudaStreamCreate()`.
3. **Perform Asynchronous Copy:** Use `cudaMemcpyAsync()` in a stream.
4. **Overlap with Kernel Execution:** Launch kernels in the same or different streams.
5. **Synchronize Streams:** Use `cudaStreamSynchronize()` or `cudaDeviceSynchronize()` to ensure operations are complete before accessing data.

---

## 5. Practical Exercise: Asynchronous Data Transfer with Kernel Overlap

We will implement a vector addition example where data is copied asynchronously using pinned memory and streams. We will also demonstrate how overlapping data transfer with kernel execution improves performance.

### a) Sample Kernel Code

```cpp
// vectorAddKernel.cu
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// Kernel for vector addition.
// Each thread calculates one element of the output vector C by adding elements from A and B.
__global__ void vectorAddKernel(const float *A, const float *B, float *C, int N) {
    int idx = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    if (idx < N) {
        C[idx] = A[idx] + B[idx];
    }
}
```

*Comments:*  
- This kernel computes a simple vector addition.
- Each thread calculates its global index and then performs element-wise addition.
- It is simple and serves as a baseline for timing experiments.

### b) Host Code with Pinned Memory and Streams

```cpp
// asyncMemoryCopyExample.cu
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

// Declaration of the vector addition kernel.
__global__ void vectorAddKernel(const float *A, const float *B, float *C, int N);

// Macro for error checking.
#define CUDA_CHECK(call) {                                      \
    cudaError_t err = call;                                     \
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {                                   \
        printf("CUDA Error at %s:%d - %s\n", __FILE__, __LINE__, cudaGetErrorString(err)); \
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);                                     \
    }                                                           \
}

int main() {
    int N = 1 << 20;  // 1 million elements.
    size_t size = N * sizeof(float);

    // Allocate pinned host memory for input and output arrays.
    float *h_A, *h_B, *h_C;
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_A, size));  // Pinned memory allocation.
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_B, size));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaMallocHost((void**)&h_C, size));

    // Initialize the host arrays with random values.
    srand(time(NULL));
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        h_A[i] = (float)(rand() % 100) / 10.0f;
        h_B[i] = (float)(rand() % 100) / 10.0f;
    }

    // Allocate device memory for vectors.
    float *d_A, *d_B, *d_C;
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaMalloc((void**)&d_A, size));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaMalloc((void**)&d_B, size));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaMalloc((void**)&d_C, size));

    // Create CUDA streams.
    cudaStream_t stream1, stream2;
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaStreamCreate(&stream1));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaStreamCreate(&stream2));

    // Asynchronously copy data from host to device using streams.
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaMemcpyAsync(d_A, h_A, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream1));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaMemcpyAsync(d_B, h_B, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice, stream1));

    // Prefetch memory to device if desired (optional).
    // CUDA_CHECK(cudaMemPrefetchAsync(d_A, size, 0, stream1));
    // CUDA_CHECK(cudaMemPrefetchAsync(d_B, size, 0, stream1));

    // Set up kernel launch configuration.
    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

    // Create CUDA events for timing.
    cudaEvent_t start, stop;
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaEventCreate(&start));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaEventCreate(&stop));

    // Record the start event on stream1.
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaEventRecord(start, stream1));

    // Launch the vector addition kernel in stream1.
    vectorAddKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock, 0, stream1>>>(d_A, d_B, d_C, N);

    // Record the stop event on stream1.
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaEventRecord(stop, stream1));

    // Meanwhile, you can perform other operations in stream2 if needed.
    // For example, asynchronously copy results from a previous computation, etc.

    // Synchronize the stream to ensure that kernel execution completes.
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaStreamSynchronize(stream1));

    // Calculate the elapsed time between start and stop events.
    float milliseconds = 0;
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaEventElapsedTime(&milliseconds, start, stop));
    printf("Kernel Execution Time (Stream1): %f ms\n", milliseconds);

    // Asynchronously copy the result from device to host.
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaMemcpyAsync(h_C, d_C, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost, stream1));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaStreamSynchronize(stream1)); // Ensure copy is complete.

    // Verify results by printing the first 10 elements.
    printf("First 10 elements of result vector:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        printf("%f ", h_C[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    // Cleanup: Free device memory, destroy streams and events, free host memory.
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaFree(d_A));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaFree(d_B));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaFree(d_C));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaStreamDestroy(stream1));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaStreamDestroy(stream2));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaEventDestroy(start));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaEventDestroy(stop));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaFreeHost(h_A));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaFreeHost(h_B));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaFreeHost(h_C));

    return 0;
}
```

*Detailed Comments Explanation:*
- **Pinned Memory Allocation:**  
  Pinned (page-locked) memory is allocated using `cudaMallocHost()` for h_A, h_B, and h_C, ensuring that memory transfers are fast and can be overlapped.
- **Device Memory Allocation:**  
  Standard `cudaMalloc()` is used to allocate memory on the GPU.
- **Stream Creation:**  
  Two streams are created; stream1 is used for asynchronous data transfer and kernel launch.
- **Asynchronous Memory Copy:**  
  Data is copied from host to device using `cudaMemcpyAsync()` on stream1, allowing overlap with kernel execution.
- **Kernel Launch:**  
  The `vectorAddKernel` is launched in stream1.  
- **Event Recording:**  
  CUDA events (`start` and `stop`) are recorded in stream1 to measure kernel execution time precisely.
- **Stream Synchronization:**  
  `cudaStreamSynchronize(stream1)` ensures that all operations in stream1 are completed before proceeding.
- **Result Copy & Verification:**  
  The output is asynchronously copied back from device to host, and then the host verifies the first few elements.
- **Resource Cleanup:**  
  All allocated resources (device memory, pinned memory, streams, events) are properly freed/destroyed.

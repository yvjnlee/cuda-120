# Day 99: Graph API for Complex DAG Workloads

In modern GPU computing, many applications require complex workflows that consist of multiple kernels, memory transfers, and conditional operations. CUDA Graphs allow you to capture and execute these workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), reducing kernel launch overhead and enabling more predictable performance. However, designing a complex DAG—with conditional branches and loop structures—requires careful planning, as overcomplicating the graph can introduce significant overhead and make debugging more challenging.

This lesson explores how to build a multi-kernel DAG using CUDA Graphs, including handling conditional branches and loops. We also discuss the trade-offs involved and provide practical examples along with comprehensive conceptual diagrams.

## 1. Overview

CUDA Graphs provide a framework to capture and replay a sequence of operations—such as kernel launches and memory transfers—as a single executable entity. This capability is especially useful for repetitive or complex workflows. On Day 99, we focus on building complex DAGs that incorporate conditional branches and loops. These constructs enable dynamic behavior in your application but also increase the risk of incurring overhead if the graph becomes too complex.

## 2. Understanding CUDA Graphs for DAG Workloads

A CUDA graph is a collection of nodes that represent kernels, memory operations, and other tasks, connected by dependency edges that define execution order. When you capture a CUDA graph:
- **Nodes:** Represent individual operations (kernel launches, memcpys, etc.).
- **Edges:** Define dependencies; a node cannot begin until all its predecessors have completed.
- **Graph Instantiation:** Once captured, a CUDA graph can be instantiated into an executable object (`cudaGraphExec_t`) and launched with minimal overhead.

The power of CUDA Graphs lies in their ability to minimize runtime overhead and provide deterministic execution in complex workflows.

## 3. Building a Multi-Kernel DAG

### a) Capturing Graphs

The typical workflow involves:
1. Creating a CUDA stream.
2. Beginning graph capture with `cudaStreamBeginCapture()`.
3. Executing a series of operations (kernels, memcpys) on the stream.
4. Ending capture with `cudaStreamEndCapture()` to produce a CUDA graph.

### b) Conditional Branches and Loops

Although CUDA Graphs do not natively support dynamic conditional branches or loops within a single graph, you can simulate these behaviors by:
- **Dynamic Graph Updates:** Using the `cudaGraphExecUpdate` API to modify nodes based on runtime conditions.
- **Graph Reuse:** Capturing multiple graphs and selecting the appropriate one based on conditional logic in host code.
- **Loop Simulation:** Replaying a graph multiple times to mimic iterative behavior.

These techniques allow you to incorporate dynamic behavior into your DAG without reconstructing the entire graph each time.

---

## 4. Pitfalls: Overcomplicating the Graph

- **Excessive Complexity:** A graph with too many nodes and dependencies may introduce overhead that negates the benefits of reduced kernel launch latency.
- **Maintenance Difficulty:** Complex graphs are harder to update and debug.  
- **Graph Update Errors:** Mishandling node updates or failing to preserve dependency relationships can lead to crashes.

The key is to strike a balance between dynamic flexibility and simplicity.

## 5. Code Example: Multi-Kernel DAG with Conditional Update

Below is an example demonstrating how to capture a CUDA graph that includes a kernel node, and then update that node dynamically based on a runtime condition (simulating a conditional branch).

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// Sample kernel that increments data by an offset.
__global__ void incrementKernel(float* d_data, int N, float offset) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    if (idx < N) {
        d_data[idx] += offset;
    }
}

int main() {
    int N = 1 << 20;
    size_t size = N * sizeof(float);
    float *d_data;
    cudaMalloc(&d_data, size);
    cudaMemset(d_data, 0, size);

    // Create a CUDA stream for graph capture.
    cudaStream_t stream;
    cudaStreamCreate(&stream);

    // Define initial kernel parameters.
    int threads = 256;
    int blocks = (N + threads - 1) / threads;
    float initOffset = 1.0f;

    // Capture the CUDA graph.
    cudaStreamBeginCapture(stream, cudaStreamCaptureModeGlobal);
    // Launch the kernel with the initial offset.
    incrementKernel<<<blocks, threads, 0, stream>>>(d_data, N, initOffset);
    cudaStreamEndCapture(stream, &graph);

    // Instantiate the captured graph.
    cudaGraphExec_t graphExec;
    cudaGraphInstantiate(&graphExec, graph, NULL, NULL, 0);

    // Launch the graph.
    cudaGraphLaunch(graphExec, stream);
    cudaStreamSynchronize(stream);

    // Suppose we now need to update the kernel offset to a new value.
    float newOffset = 2.0f;
    // Prepare new kernel node parameters (for simplicity, assume graph has one node).
    cudaKernelNodeParams newKernelParams = {0};
    void* newArgs[3] = { (void*)&d_data, (void*)&N, (void*)&newOffset };
    newKernelParams.func = (void*)incrementKernel;
    newKernelParams.gridDim = dim3(blocks);
    newKernelParams.blockDim = dim3(threads);
    newKernelParams.sharedMemBytes = 0;
    newKernelParams.kernelParams = newArgs;

    // Update the graph with the new parameters.
    size_t numUpdatedNodes;
    cudaGraphExecUpdate(graphExec, graph, NULL, NULL, &numUpdatedNodes);
    printf("Graph updated: %zu node(s) modified.\n", numUpdatedNodes);

    // Re-launch the updated graph.
    cudaGraphLaunch(graphExec, stream);
    cudaStreamSynchronize(stream);

    // Cleanup.
    cudaGraphExecDestroy(graphExec);
    cudaGraphDestroy(graph);
    cudaStreamDestroy(stream);
    cudaFree(d_data);

    return 0;
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The graph is captured with an initial kernel launch using an offset of 1.0.
- The graph is instantiated and launched.
- Later, the kernel's offset is updated to 2.0 using the CUDA Graph Update API.
- Proper error checking and node management are required to ensure the update succeeds.

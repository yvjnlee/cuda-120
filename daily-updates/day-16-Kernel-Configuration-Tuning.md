# Day 16: Kernel Configuration Tuning

In this lesson, we explore how to tune kernel configuration in CUDA by adjusting block sizes and thread counts. The goal is to understand how these changes affect occupancy and overall performance. We will perform practical experiments by running the same kernel with different block dimensions, observe occupancy changes, and identify common pitfalls such as using non-multiples of the warp size. We will also use the CUDA Occupancy Calculator (available within Nsight Compute) as a reference for tuning.

This comprehensive guide covers all steps from code implementation and extensive inline comments to conceptual diagrams that illustrate how kernel occupancy is determined and how block configuration affects performance.

## 1. Overview

Kernel configuration tuning involves adjusting the number of threads per block and the grid dimensions to maximize hardware utilization and occupancy. Occupancy is the ratio of active warps per multiprocessor to the maximum number of warps that can be active. Higher occupancy can help hide latency, though it is not the only factor in performance.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Block Size:** The number of threads per block. Optimally, this should be a multiple of the warp size (typically 32) to ensure full utilization of the hardware.
- **Grid Size:** The total number of blocks launched.
- **Occupancy:** A measure of how many warps are active on a Streaming Multiprocessor (SM) compared to the hardwareâ€™s maximum.
- **Tools:** The CUDA Occupancy Calculator in Nsight Compute can help determine optimal configurations.

## 2. Understanding Kernel Occupancy

Occupancy is influenced by:
- **Block Size:** Using non-multiples of the warp size (32) can lower occupancy since some threads in a warp may be idle.
- **Resource Usage:** Register and shared memory usage per thread/block.
- **Hardware Limits:** Maximum number of threads per block and available shared memory per SM.

**Why It Matters:**  
Higher occupancy can hide memory latency by allowing other warps to execute while one warp is waiting for memory operations to complete. However, extremely high occupancy does not always translate to better performance if the kernel is bound by other factors.

## 3. Practical Exercise: Tuning Kernel Block Sizes

In this exercise, we will implement a simple vector addition kernel and then run it with different block sizes to observe occupancy changes and performance differences. We will use CUDA events to time the kernel execution.

### a) Sample Kernel Code

Below is the vector addition kernel with extensive inline comments:

```cpp
// vectorAddKernel.cu
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// Kernel: Vector Addition
// Each thread computes one element of the output vector.
// The kernel expects that the total number of threads covers the entire vector.
__global__ void vectorAddKernel(const float *A, const float *B, float *C, int N) {
    // Calculate the global index of the thread.
    int idx = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    
    // Boundary check: ensure the index does not exceed the vector length.
    if (idx < N) {
        // Perform the addition operation.
        C[idx] = A[idx] + B[idx];
    }
}
```

### b) Host Code for Tuning and Measuring Performance

The host code allows you to change the block size and measure execution time using CUDA events. Extensive comments are provided to explain each step.

```cpp
// kernelTuning.cu
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

// Declaration of the vector addition kernel.
__global__ void vectorAddKernel(const float *A, const float *B, float *C, int N);

int main() {
    // Vector length.
    int N = 1 << 20;  // 1M elements
    size_t size = N * sizeof(float);

    // Allocate host memory for input vectors and output vector.
    float *h_A = (float*)malloc(size);
    float *h_B = (float*)malloc(size);
    float *h_C = (float*)malloc(size);

    // Initialize host arrays with random values.
    srand(time(NULL));
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        h_A[i] = (float)(rand() % 100) / 10.0f;
        h_B[i] = (float)(rand() % 100) / 10.0f;
    }

    // Allocate device memory for vectors.
    float *d_A, *d_B, *d_C;
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_A, size);
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_B, size);
    cudaMalloc((void**)&d_C, size);

    // Copy input data from host to device.
    cudaMemcpy(d_A, h_A, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);
    cudaMemcpy(d_B, h_B, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice);

    // Define a range of block sizes to test (e.g., multiples of warp size 32).
    int blockSizes[] = {32, 64, 128, 256, 512};
    int numBlockSizes = sizeof(blockSizes) / sizeof(blockSizes[0]);
    float timeTaken;

    // Create CUDA events for timing.
    cudaEvent_t start, stop;
    cudaEventCreate(&start);
    cudaEventCreate(&stop);

    // Loop through the different block sizes.
    for (int i = 0; i < numBlockSizes; i++) {
        int threadsPerBlock = blockSizes[i];
        int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

        // Record the start event.
        cudaEventRecord(start);

        // Launch the kernel with the current configuration.
        vectorAddKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_A, d_B, d_C, N);

        // Record the stop event.
        cudaEventRecord(stop);
        cudaEventSynchronize(stop);

        // Calculate the elapsed time.
        cudaEventElapsedTime(&timeTaken, start, stop);
        printf("Block Size: %d, Blocks Per Grid: %d, Time Taken: %f ms\n", threadsPerBlock, blocksPerGrid, timeTaken);
    }

    // Optionally, copy the result back to host for correctness verification.
    cudaMemcpy(h_C, d_C, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost);

    // Free device memory.
    cudaFree(d_A);
    cudaFree(d_B);
    cudaFree(d_C);

    // Free host memory.
    free(h_A);
    free(h_B);
    free(h_C);

    // Destroy CUDA events.
    cudaEventDestroy(start);
    cudaEventDestroy(stop);

    return 0;
}
```

*Detailed Comments Explanation:*  
- **Memory Allocation:**  
  Host and device memory are allocated for three vectors (A, B, C).
- **Initialization:**  
  Random values are assigned to the input vectors.
- **Kernel Configuration:**  
  A loop tests various block sizes (multiples of 32) to observe how different configurations affect kernel performance and occupancy.
- **Timing:**  
  CUDA events are used to record and measure the execution time for each kernel launch.
- **Output:**  
  The program prints the block size, grid configuration, and execution time for each test.
- **Cleanup:**  
  All allocated memory and events are properly freed/destroyed.

## 4. Common Pitfalls and Debugging Strategies

### Pitfalls:
1. **Non-Multiples of Warp Size:**  
   - **Issue:**  
     Using a block size that is not a multiple of 32 may result in underutilized warps and lower occupancy.
   - **Mitigation:**  
     Always try to use block sizes that are multiples of 32.
2. **Over- or Under-utilization of Resources:**  
   - **Issue:**  
     Too many threads per block might exhaust registers or shared memory, lowering occupancy.
   - **Mitigation:**  
     Use the CUDA Occupancy Calculator (available within Nsight Compute) to find optimal configurations.
3. **Ignoring CUDA API Error Checking:**  
   - **Issue:**  
     Failing to check return values can lead to silent errors.
   - **Mitigation:**  
     Always check the return values of CUDA API calls.

## Debugging Strategies:
- **Use CUDA Occupancy Calculator:**  
  Tools like Nsight Compute provide detailed occupancy reports.
- **Profile Your Kernel:**  
  Use NVIDIA NSight Compute to analyze how different block sizes impact occupancy and performance.
- **Iterative Testing:**  
  Test with various configurations and compare execution times to find the optimal setup.

```
*Explanation:*  
- This diagram shows how the vector size and chosen block size determine the grid configuration.
- The scheduler maps these threads to SMs where occupancy is influenced by whether block sizes form complete warps.
- Finally, execution time is measured to analyze performance.

    B[Launch Kernel and Measure Time]
    C[Calculate Occupancy using CUDA Occupancy Calculator]
    D{Is Occupancy Optimal?}
    E[Yes: Record and Compare Performance]
    F[No: Adjust Block Size (e.g., 128, 512)]
    G[Repeat Kernel Launch and Measurement]
    
    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D

    D -- No --> F
    F --> B
```
*Explanation:*  
- The tuning workflow involves starting with an initial block size, measuring performance, and checking occupancy.
- If occupancy is not optimal, the block size is adjusted and the process repeats.
- This iterative process helps in finding the best configuration.

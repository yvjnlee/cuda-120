# Day 26: Constant Memory
In this lesson, we will explore **Constant Memory** in CUDA. Constant memory is a small region of memory that is cached on-chip and optimized for read-only data. It is especially useful for storing constants such as filter coefficients, lookup tables, or any other data that does not change during kernel execution.

## 1. Overview

In CUDA, **constant memory** is used to store data that does not change over the course of kernel execution. Because it is cached on-chip, constant memory provides very fast access for all threads in a warp when the data is accessed uniformly. However, constant memory is limited in size (typically 64KB on most architectures), so it must be used judiciously.

---

## 2. What is Constant Memory?

**Constant Memory** in CUDA is declared with the `__constant__` qualifier and is:
- **Read-only** during kernel execution.
- **Cached** on the GPU, allowing for low-latency access.
- Ideal for storing data such as coefficients, lookup tables, and fixed parameters.

**Declaration Example:**
```cpp
__constant__ float constCoeffs[16];
```
This declares a constant memory array that can be accessed by all threads but cannot be modified by the device kernels.

---

## 3. Advantages and Limitations of Constant Memory

**Advantages**  
- **Low Latency:**  
  Data in constant memory is cached, so when all threads access the same location, the value is broadcast to all threads quickly.  
- **Efficient for Uniform Access:**  
  When many threads read the same value (or adjacent values) from constant memory, the hardware efficiently serves the request.  
- **Simplifies Data Management:**  
  Useful for storing fixed parameters or coefficients without needing to update them during kernel execution.  

**Limitations**  
- **Limited Size:**  
  Constant memory is typically limited to 64KB (architecture-dependent). Exceeding this limit will result in errors.  
- **Read-Only Access:**  
  Data stored in constant memory must remain unchanged during kernel execution. Attempting to write to constant memory from device code will cause errors.  
- **Access Patterns:**  
  For maximum performance, the data should be accessed uniformly across threads in a warp.

---

## 4. Using Constant Memory in CUDA

To use constant memory:  
- Declare a constant variable at global scope with the `__constant__` qualifier.  
- Copy data to constant memory from the host using `cudaMemcpyToSymbol()`.  
- Access constant memory within kernels like any other array. All threads can read from it at high speed.  

**Example Declaration:**
```cpp
__constant__ float constCoeffs[16];
```

**Copying Data to Constant Memory (Host Code):**
```cpp
float h_coeffs[16] = { /* your constant coefficients */ };
cudaMemcpyToSymbol(constCoeffs, h_coeffs, 16 * sizeof(float));
```

---

## 5. Practical Exercise: Vector Scaling with Constant Coefficients

In this exercise, we will implement a simple vector scaling operation where each element of a vector is multiplied by a constant coefficient. The coefficient will be stored in constant memory.

### 5.1. Kernel Code

```cpp
// vectorScaleKernel.cu
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// Declare a constant memory variable to store the scaling factor.
__constant__ float scaleFactor;

// Kernel for scaling a vector using the constant scale factor.
__global__ void vectorScaleKernel(const float *input, float *output, int N) {
    // Compute global thread index.
    int idx = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    
    // Check bounds to prevent out-of-bounds access.
    if (idx < N) {
        // Multiply each element by the constant scaling factor.
        output[idx] = input[idx] * scaleFactor;
    }
}
```

**Comments:**  
- The constant memory variable `scaleFactor` holds the read-only scaling factor.  
- Each thread computes its global index and scales the corresponding element.  
- The kernel uses a simple boundary check.

### 5.2. Host Code with Detailed Error Checking and Comments

```cpp
// vectorScaleWithConstantMemory.cu
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

// Declaration of the vector scaling kernel.
__global__ void vectorScaleKernel(const float *input, float *output, int N);

// Declare the constant memory variable to store the scale factor.
__constant__ float scaleFactor;

#define CUDA_CHECK(call) {                                      \
    cudaError_t err = call;                                     \
    if (err != cudaSuccess) {                                   \
        printf("CUDA Error at %s:%d - %s\n", __FILE__, __LINE__, cudaGetErrorString(err)); \
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);                                     \
    }                                                           \
}

int main() {
    // Define vector size.
    int N = 1 << 20;  // 1 million elements.
    size_t size = N * sizeof(float);

    // Allocate host memory using standard malloc (for this example).
    float *h_input = (float*)malloc(size);
    float *h_output = (float*)malloc(size);
    if (!h_input || !h_output) {
        printf("Host memory allocation failed\n");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // Initialize the host input vector with random values.
    srand(time(NULL));
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        h_input[i] = (float)(rand() % 100) / 10.0f;
    }

    // Allocate device memory.
    float *d_input, *d_output;
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaMalloc((void**)&d_input, size));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaMalloc((void**)&d_output, size));

    // Copy input data from host to device.
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaMemcpy(d_input, h_input, size, cudaMemcpyHostToDevice));

    // Set the constant scale factor on the device using cudaMemcpyToSymbol.
    float h_scale = 2.5f;  // Example scale factor.
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaMemcpyToSymbol(scaleFactor, &h_scale, sizeof(float)));

    // Define kernel launch parameters.
    int threadsPerBlock = 256;
    int blocksPerGrid = (N + threadsPerBlock - 1) / threadsPerBlock;

    // Create CUDA events for timing.
    cudaEvent_t start, stop;
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaEventCreate(&start));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaEventCreate(&stop));

    // Record the start event.
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaEventRecord(start, 0));

    // Launch the vector scaling kernel.
    vectorScaleKernel<<<blocksPerGrid, threadsPerBlock>>>(d_input, d_output, N);

    // Record the stop event.
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaEventRecord(stop, 0));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaEventSynchronize(stop));

    // Calculate elapsed time.
    float elapsedTime = 0;
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaEventElapsedTime(&elapsedTime, start, stop));
    printf("Kernel Execution Time: %f ms\n", elapsedTime);

    // Copy the result vector from device back to host.
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaMemcpy(h_output, d_output, size, cudaMemcpyDeviceToHost));

    // Verify results by printing the first 10 elements.
    printf("First 10 elements of the scaled vector:\n");
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        printf("%f ", h_output[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");

    // Clean up: Free device memory, destroy events, and free host memory.
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaFree(d_input));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaFree(d_output));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaEventDestroy(start));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaEventDestroy(stop));
    free(h_input);
    free(h_output);

    return 0;
}
```

**Detailed Comments Explanation:**  
- **Host Memory Allocation:**  
  Uses standard `malloc()` for simplicity in this example.  
- **Device Memory Allocation:**  
  Uses `cudaMalloc()` to allocate memory on the GPU.  
- **Constant Memory Setup:**  
  The host sets the value of `scaleFactor` using `cudaMemcpyToSymbol()`, which copies the value to constant memory.  
- **Kernel Launch:**  
  The kernel is launched with grid and block dimensions calculated from the vector size.  
- **CUDA Events for Timing:**  
  CUDA events record the start and stop times of the kernel execution for performance measurement.  
- **Result Verification:**  
  The output is copied back to host memory and printed to verify correct scaling.  
- **Resource Cleanup:**  
  All resources (device memory, events, host memory) are properly freed to prevent leaks.
